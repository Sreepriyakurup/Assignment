# Q.1. Create two int type variables, apply addition, subtraction, division and multiplications
# and store the results in variables. Then print the data in the following format by calling the
# variables:

# a= int(input("Enter first number: "))
# b= int(input("Enter first number: "))
# 
# print("First variable is ", a , '& second variable is', b)
# print('Addition : ', a,'+',b ,'= ', a+b)
# print('Subtraction : ', a,'-',b ,'= ', a-b)
# print('Multiplication : ', a,'*',b ,'= ', a*b)
# print('Division : ', a,'/',b ,'= ', a/b)
# 

# Enter first number: 2
# Enter first number: 3
# First variable is  2 & second variable is 3
# Addition :  2 + 3 =  5
# Subtraction :  2 - 3 =  -1
# Multiplication :  2 * 3 =  6
# Division :  2 / 3 =  0.6666666666666666

# Q.2. What is the difference between the following operators:
#     
# (i) ‘/’ & ‘//’
# '/' represents division
# '//' represents floor division
# 
# (ii) ‘**’ & ‘^’
# '**' represents exponent operator
# '^' represents EXOR operator

# Q.3. List the logical operators.
# 
# Logical operators are and, or, not.

# Q.4. Explain right shift operator and left shift operator with examples.
# 
# Right Shift operator: Shifts the bits of the number to the right by the number of bits specified. Each shift to the right corresponds to dividing the number by 2.
# 

# a=16
# result = a >> 3
# print(result)

# 2

# Left Shift Operator: Shifts the bits of the number to the left by the number of bits specified. Each shift to the left corresponds to multiplying the number by 2.

# a=16
# result = a << 3
# print(result)

# 128

# Q.5. Create a list containing int type data of length 15. Then write a code to check if 10 is
# present in the list or not.

# l=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,14,15]
# print(10 in l)               
#     

# True
